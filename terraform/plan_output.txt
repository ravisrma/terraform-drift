Error: Backend initialization required, please run "terraform init"

Reason: Initial configuration of the requested backend "s3"

The "backend" is the interface that Terraform uses to store state,
perform operations, etc. If this message is showing up, it means that the
Terraform configuration you're using is using a custom configuration for
the Terraform backend.

Changes to backend configurations require reinitialization. This allows
Terraform to set up the new configuration, copy existing state, etc. Please
run
"terraform init" with either the "-reconfigure" or "-migrate-state" flags to
use the current configuration.

If the change reason above is incorrect, please verify your configuration
hasn't changed and try again. At this point, no changes to your existing
configuration or state have been made.
